Was called out to this site to troubleshoot an offline scanner scale model 7879-2000, it turned out that the unit only needs to be rebooted, however the scanner skill also had a media Jam in the coin diverter which way is causing it to have problems with cash handling, of course. I cleared out that blockage, and will soon test all components in PML before testing with customer transactions. upon reboot I found that the handheld scanner firmware update stalls the entire reboot of the register, I contacted the help desk to see if they had any suggestions and they just said, well, I'm sorry reseeding the cable and then will clear the firmware and try rebooting one more time. this was enough to get the register to boot properly all systems online. Thanks all!

O14- Previously arrived onsite and chk'd in w/TL AARON. Began to investigate reported issue SCO 32 R5 DR is not reading gift cards. Connected w/APM RICHARD and he escorted me to suspect sco and explained debit reader is not processing wm gift cards. sco online in full service mode, customer checking out. Watched customer use chip card to complete transaction. Richard then tried to make purchase using his wm gift card but dr did not recognize. After he switched payment method to gift card on screen, he swiped card and display changed on isc250 screen, then processed his transaction. We think error is that customers using wm gift cards for payment must first select that payment option before swiping in order for payment to process. Closing task per APM RICHARD; all ops chkd okay.

when I arrived on-site, register 28th was in use by customers, who were clearly using the scanner scale in order to scan their purchases. I kept an eye on this and watched out for issues anyone might be having, while I had to look at a different register for which I was at the store also. I spoke to staff at the self-checkout who pointed out that the handheld Scanner was bound vcd tightly to its holder with packing tape, and that they've been informed that the pan held was not working, hence the tape, and the staff also reported that they had not witnessed any issues with the scanner scale. after cutting the handheld free I tried scanning to see what would happen, since it was producing a bean. turned out the scanner works properly, and both me and Associate Mari were you able to scan products without any difficulty. just to be sure I tried scanning and Weighing on the scanner scale and it worked fine for me. If the reported issues we're present earlier in the day, they went away on their own, possibly via a register restart at some point. in any case I was unable to observe the reported issues. Thanks all!

Customer reports that there is an Error: Dual Coin Entry Blocked... Upon inspection, I do confirm this error. During my troubleshooting I found a $0.25 (Quarter) stuck in between the Coin Validator and the Deposit Chute.  This Quarter has a large amount of sticky material (gum??) on both sides of the Coin --- pics attached ---.  Once I removed the Bad Coin, the Errors went away after a Diagnostics Check.  I then used the Powered Air Blower and Tech Wipes to Clean the SCO.  After returning the SCO to Service, I observed 3 Customers make successful purchases.  I then also make a successful purchase via CC.  I checked out locally with WM Cashier Chris, and then I took the Bad Coin to WM Lead Scott and updated him.  Scott asked around to the other Leads about other problems... they directed me to SCO 22; a quick look showed it to be put of Cash Notes...I asked them to open a ticket if refilling the SCO did not help.
