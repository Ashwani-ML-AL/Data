I kept an eye on this and watched out for issues anyone might be having, while I had to look at a different register for which I was at the store also. I spoke to staff at the self-checkout who pointed out that the handheld Scanner was bound vcd tightly to its holder with packing tape, and that they've been informed that the pan held was not working, hence the tape, and the staff also reported that they had not witnessed any issues with the scanner scale. after cutting the handheld free I tried scanning to see what would happen, since it was producing a bean. turned out the scanner works properly, and both me and Associate Mari were you able to scan products without any difficulty. just to be sure I tried scanning and Weighing on the scanner scale and it worked fine for me. If the reported issues we're present earlier in the day, they went away on their own, possibly via a register restart at some point. in any case I was unable to observe the reported issues.

This Quarter has a large amount of sticky material (gum??) on both sides of the Coin --- pics attached ---.  Once I removed the Bad Coin, the Errors went away after a Diagnostics Check.  I then used the Powered Air Blower and Tech Wipes to Clean the SCO.  After returning the SCO to Service, I observed 3 Customers make successful purchases.  I then also make a successful purchase via CC.  I checked out locally with WM Cashier Chris, and then I took the Bad Coin to WM Lead Scott and updated him.  Scott asked around to the other Leads about other problems... they directed me to SCO 22; a quick look showed it to be put of Cash Notes...I asked them to open a ticket if refilling the SCO did not help."
